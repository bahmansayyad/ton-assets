  IRANOIL is a utility token on the TON blockchain, inspired by the strategic value of crude oil.  
  With a fixed total supply of 20,000,000,000 units (twenty billion) and 9 decimals, IRANOIL aims to serve as a transparent, fast, and secure foundation for transactions, investments, and energy-related projects within the Web3 ecosystem.

  ðŸ“Š Token Distribution:
  - 50% distributed to 21 wallets for decentralization (completed)
  - 20% allocated for liquidity provision on TON DEX (added gradually in multiple stages)
  - 10% reserved for marketing, community growth, and airdrops
  - 10% reserved for development and partnerships
  - 10% reserved for future burns:
    Burn will happen in 4 phases. Each phase burns 5% of the tokens sold from the 20% public sale. ðŸ”¥

  ðŸš€ Roadmap:
  - Phase 0 â€” Launch: Deploy Jetton contract, publish metadata on GitHub, list in TON wallets, and provide initial DEX liquidity.
  - Phase 1 â€” Accessibility: List on major TON DEX platforms, activate community channels, attract early holders, and run AMA sessions.
  - Phase 2 â€” Adoption: Seek partnerships with Web3 projects, integrate Iranoil into small services, and build simple payment tools.
  - Phase 3 â€” Expansion & Burn: Strengthen liquidity, apply for CEX listings once the community is strong, complete smart contract audits, and execute token burns.
